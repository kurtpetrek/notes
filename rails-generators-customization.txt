# To prevent rails from automatically generating stylesheets that need to be deleted put the following code in /config/application.rb under class Application < Rails::Application

config.generators do |g|
  g.orm              :active_record
  g.template_engine  :erb
  g.test_framework   :test_unit, fixture: false
  g.stylesheets      false
  g.javascripts      false
end



## The following did not work check guide to troubleshoot

# To overide the default table format generated for scaffolds with a custom format on the index page create the following path within the lib directory

lib>templates>erb>scaffold>index.html.erb

# Next go to rails source code for scaffolds and copy the page which you would like to customize https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/railties/lib/rails/generators/erb/scaffold/templates then change the html and content to the desired html format
